Credit card scanning example for iOS card.io
============================================

To give this a try:

1. Download an archive of [the most recent release](https://github.com/card-io/card.io-iOS-SDK/releases) of the card.io SDK.
2. [Sign up for a developer account](https://www.card.io/accounts/register/developer) and [get an app token](https://www.card.io/apps/).
3. Set your credentials:
    1. In `ScanExample/Constants.h`, set the value of `APP_TOKEN_FROM_WEBSITE` to your app token.
    2. Run `sh ignore.sh ignore` so that git will ignore your change to `ScanExample/Constants.h`
4. Using Xcode 5.0 or newer, open `ScanExample.xcodeproj`, build and run.

That's it!!
